# turkish-morph-lexicon


This is a lexicon for Turkish morphology. Each entry in the lexicon corresponds to a pair of the word form and its morphological analysis. Here's an example:

```
evde ev,N,case.loc
gittim git,V,past,v1s
```

Each analysis line consists of

* lemma word
* POS tag of the lemma
* A list of morphological tags.

The complete list of the morphological tags and their corresponding morphemes can be found at  [tagset](tagset.md) and [list of suffixes](suffixes/suffixes.txt).


The licence is MIT. Citation notes will come soon.
